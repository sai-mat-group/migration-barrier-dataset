# Migration barrier dataset
Dataset of calculated migration barriers over a wide range of electrode and solid electrolyte materials that have been explored for battery applications. The dataset is part of the work, "A literature-derived dataset of migration barriers for quantifying ionic transport in battery materials" by Reshma Devi, Avaneesh Balasubramanian, Keith Butler, and Gopalakrishnan Sai Gautam that is currently under review. A pre-print of the manuscript can be found on [arXiv](https://arxiv.org).
